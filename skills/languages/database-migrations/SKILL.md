# Database Migration Patterns

Safe, reversible database schema changes for production systems.

## When to Activate

- Creating or altering database tables
- Adding/removing columns or indexes
- Running data migrations (backfill, transform)
- Planning zero-downtime schema changes
- Setting up migration tooling for a new project

## Core Principles

1. **Every change is a migration** — never alter production databases manually
2. **Migrations are forward-only in production** — rollbacks use new forward migrations
3. **Schema and data migrations are separate** — never mix DDL and DML in one migration
4. **Test migrations against production-sized data** — a migration that works on 100 rows may lock on 10M
5. **Migrations are immutable once deployed** — never edit a migration that has run in production

## Migration Safety Checklist

Before applying any migration:

- [ ] Migration has both UP and DOWN (or is explicitly marked irreversible)
- [ ] No full table locks on large tables (use concurrent operations)
- [ ] New columns have defaults or are nullable (never add NOT NULL without default)
- [ ] Indexes created concurrently (not inline with CREATE TABLE for existing tables)
- [ ] Data backfill is a separate migration from schema change
- [ ] Tested against a copy of production data
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## PostgreSQL Patterns

### Adding a Column Safely

```sql
-- GOOD: Nullable column, no lock
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;

-- GOOD: Column with default (Postgres 11+ is instant, no rewrite)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;

-- BAD: NOT NULL without default on existing table (requires full rewrite)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role TEXT NOT NULL;
-- This locks the table and rewrites every row
```

### Adding an Index Without Downtime

```sql
-- BAD: Blocks writes on large tables
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);

-- GOOD: Non-blocking, allows concurrent writes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users (email);

-- Note: CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction block
-- Most migration tools need special handling for this
```

### Renaming a Column (Zero-Downtime)

Never rename directly in production. Use the expand-contract pattern:

```sql
-- Step 1: Add new column (migration 001)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN display_name TEXT;

-- Step 2: Backfill data (migration 002, data migration)
UPDATE users SET display_name = username WHERE display_name IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Update application code to read/write both columns
-- Deploy application changes

-- Step 4: Stop writing to old column, drop it (migration 003)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN username;
```

### Removing a Column Safely

```sql
-- Step 1: Remove all application references to the column
-- Step 2: Deploy application without the column reference
-- Step 3: Drop column in next migration
ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN legacy_status;
```

### Large Data Migrations

```sql
-- BAD: Updates all rows in one transaction (locks table)
UPDATE users SET normalized_email = LOWER(email);

-- GOOD: Batch update with progress
DO $$
DECLARE
  batch_size INT := 10000;
  rows_updated INT;
BEGIN
  LOOP
    UPDATE users
    SET normalized_email = LOWER(email)
    WHERE id IN (
      SELECT id FROM users
      WHERE normalized_email IS NULL
      LIMIT batch_size
      FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    );
    GET DIAGNOSTICS rows_updated = ROW_COUNT;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Updated % rows', rows_updated;
    EXIT WHEN rows_updated = 0;
    COMMIT;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## Flyway (Java / Spring Boot)

### Setup (build.gradle)

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.flywaydb:flyway-core'
    // For MySQL: also add flyway-mysql
    implementation 'org.flywaydb:flyway-mysql'
}
```

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
    locations: classpath:db/migration
    baseline-on-migrate: false
```

### Naming Convention

```
V{version}__{description}.sql      ← versioned migration (runs once)
R__{description}.sql               ← repeatable migration (runs when changed)
U{version}__{description}.sql      ← undo migration (Flyway Teams only)
```

Examples:
```
V1__create_users_table.sql
V2__add_avatar_url_to_users.sql
V3__backfill_display_name.sql
R__create_views.sql
```

### Workflow Commands

```bash
# Apply pending migrations (also runs automatically on app startup)
./gradlew flywayMigrate

# Check migration status
./gradlew flywayInfo

# Validate migrations match checksums
./gradlew flywayValidate

# Repair failed migration (fix checksum mismatch or mark as failed)
./gradlew flywayRepair

# Clean all objects (dev only — NEVER in production)
./gradlew flywayClean
```

### Migration File Example

```sql
-- src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__add_avatar_url_to_users.sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url VARCHAR(500);

-- src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__add_email_index.sql
-- For MySQL, use standard CREATE INDEX (no CONCURRENTLY)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
```

### Flyway Rules

- **Never edit a deployed migration file** — Flyway validates checksums; any edit causes `FlywayValidationException`
- **Use `flywayRepair` only** when a migration failed mid-run and left a dirty state
- **`flywayClean` is destructive** — disable in production with `spring.flyway.clean-disabled=true`
- **Separate schema and data** — DDL changes and data backfills must be separate migration files

## Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

For critical production changes, follow the expand-contract pattern:

```
Phase 1: EXPAND
  - Add new column/table (nullable or with default)
  - Deploy: app writes to BOTH old and new
  - Backfill existing data

Phase 2: MIGRATE
  - Deploy: app reads from NEW, writes to BOTH
  - Verify data consistency

Phase 3: CONTRACT
  - Deploy: app only uses NEW
  - Drop old column/table in separate migration
```

### Timeline Example

```
Day 1: Migration adds new_status column (nullable)
Day 1: Deploy app v2 — writes to both status and new_status
Day 2: Run backfill migration for existing rows
Day 3: Deploy app v3 — reads from new_status only
Day 7: Migration drops old status column
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Manual SQL in production | No audit trail, unrepeatable | Always use migration files |
| Editing deployed migrations | Causes drift between environments | Create new migration instead |
| NOT NULL without default | Locks table, rewrites all rows | Add nullable, backfill, then add constraint |
| Inline index on large table | Blocks writes during build | CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY |
| Schema + data in one migration | Hard to rollback, long transactions | Separate migrations |
| Dropping column before removing code | Application errors on missing column | Remove code first, drop column next deploy |
